EMS and the Event Organisers
Please have a look at the video tutorial “EMS Role and function of the Organiser”
1. If not yet done, become an EMS user
This will allow you to work with the EMS system. If you haven’t received an invitation to become a user yet
or you are not sure whether you are in the EMS system, please contact your National Federation for more
information. Each National Federation has at least one EMS Administrator who can help you. The
procedure is easy: you receive a mail from your Federation and you just have to click “I agree” and follow
the instructions to enter your confidential password to confirm your EMS membership.
2. EMS makes it easy for you
EMS offers already a number of functions which serve the Organisers to administer their competitions:
• Publication of competitions details and bulletins
• Control of Athletes participations
• Waiting List management
• Jury Panel invitations
• Emails to Jury Panel and participants
• Download of competition information, Jury Panel and participants to scoring system
• Publication of competition results
• Publication scoring system reports (start lists, event schedules, participant lists, team results)
• Download to Excel.
• More supporting functions are planned in future (e.g. collection of Entry Fees, etc.).
To make sure that everything runs smoothly, please:
- Register your competitions in EMS before the season start according to the deadlines of your
Confederation/Federation. The competitions need to be approved by your Federation. In some
Federations the registration is done centrally by the Federation
• When a competition is created in EMS, very important:
- In the “Organiser Contact Person” section please click your Name in the “Assigned Organiser
(User)” box. Only the User assigned in this box has full access right to the competition details and
can fulfil the functions as mentioned above
- The “Entry Status” is set to “Registrations Pending” in the “Entry Options”. Set it to “Registration
Open” once Athletes are allowed to register to the event
- Ask your participants to register to your competition directly in EMS. This way you avoid manual entry
forms and Excel based participants lists. If a participant cannot register because his/her name is not in
EMS, contact your EMS Federation Administrator
• Please note that all participants for Ranking List competitions must hold a valid IWWF Licence*. Please
draw their attention to this obligation in the competition bulletin/information you are publishing. If you
ask your participants to register in EMS directly, the IWWF Licence* check is done automatically

- If your competition is “Invitational”, please register your participants in EMS and if a participant is
missing in EMS, contact your EMS Federation Administrator
- EMS offers the Organiser of a competition to manage the Jury Panel invitation process through EMS.
It is no more necessary to write individual/manual emails:
- Invite your Officials through EMS in the Jury Panel tab (“+Add Official” button). The Official
will receive an email and is requested to accept or reject the invitation in his Jury Panel
EMS menu through appropriate buttons.
- Officials should regularly consult their “My Jury Panels” menu function in EMS and check
whether they have not responded to invitations. If not, we recommend that you remind
them to confirm the invitation through the “Accept” or “Reject” button
- As long as the Official has not responded his status in the Jury Panel is “Invited by
Fed/Organiser”. Depending on his answer the status will change to “Accepted” or
“Rejected”
- If an Official is missing in EMS, contact your EMS Federation Administrator to have him
registered
- Verify regularly the status of the Jury Panel of your competitions. If there are open answers
remind the Officials to respond
- The Official can ask in EMS for the participation as a Jury Panel member. In this case, the
Organiser will see his request in the Jury Panel with status “Requested by Official”. The
buttons “Accept” or “Reject” are available to respond to their requests. The Official will
receive an appropriate email
- Very important: In order that Scorers/Calculators or Assistant Scorers/Calculators can fulfil their
duties in EMS (download the competition to the scoring system and upload the results from the
scoring system to EMS, etc.), they must be accepted Officials in the Jury Panel. If not, we
recommend that you remind them to do so
- In order to avoid problems please be informed that the Scorers/Calculators must register their
participants and Jury Panel in EMS and download them to the scoring system. Therefore, the
Scorers/Calculators:
- SHOULD NOT add any Official or any Athlete directly in the scoring system
- SHOULD NOT create a competition directly in the scoring system
It is possible to add last minute arrivals in EMS and the Scorers/Calculators can do an incremental
download of Athletes and Officials to the scoring system. This makes sure that the data is correctly
registered in the scoring system and the upload of results to EMS will work without errors. As said
above, this will also automatically check whether the participants hold an IWWF Licence* for Ranking
List competitions.
• Attention! If an Athlete is exceptionally registered directly in the scoring system and has no IWWF
Licence*, it will block the entire results upload in EMS
• Last but not least, purchasing an IWWF License* is very quick and easy and can be done on site on a
smartphone. If the Athlete do not find his name in the database to purchase his license, please contact
your EMS Federation Administrator.
3. Questions, Problems?
